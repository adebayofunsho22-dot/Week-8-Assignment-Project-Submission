# 🏥 Clinic Booking System – Database Project

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a **Clinic Booking System** designed and implemented in **MySQL**.  
It demonstrates good database design principles, normalization, and the use of proper constraints and relationships.  

The system manages:
- Patient registration and profiles  
- Staff (doctors, nurses, admin) and their specialties  
- Clinic rooms and appointments  
- Prescriptions and medications  
- Invoices and payments  

It showcases **1–1, 1–M, and M–M relationships**, data integrity with constraints, and normalization up to 3NF.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a well-structured relational database.  
- Apply **normalization** techniques to reduce redundancy and improve integrity.  
- Define relationships with **Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, and CHECK** constraints.  
- Provide a real-world use case (Clinic Booking System).
